# Calcium_signal_analysis
These codes are used for the correction and calculation of neuronal calcium fluorescence. Please use them in the MATLAB environment.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c2492fe-3356-4bbc-ad5f-a1073486cd21)


Usage Instructions:
This program identifies and calculates microscopy imaging videos in TIFF format. To correct the images, please run auto_wgy_lky_vtf located in the code folder. For digitizing the corrected image data, please run auto_measure_adjust located in the code folder (the position of the neurons, i.e., the ROI, needs to be manually selected).
